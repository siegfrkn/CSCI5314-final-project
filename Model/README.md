Files related to the modeling for this project.

Note: the html web-version of the model is currently unsupported due to a lack of support for the time extension in the web version of netlogo (currently only available in desktop).

### Downloading and Running the Model
This model uses the time extension which is not currently supported by the web version of netlogo, and must be downloaded for use with the desktop version 6.0 or later.

The model file is stored under the file model_sim_prarie_dogs.nlogo, and utilizes six supporting netlogo library files which must all be located in the same directory.

To view model, download all files to the same directory and open the model_sim_prarie_dogs.nlogo file with netlogo desktop. The included library files will be linked automatically.
